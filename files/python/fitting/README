BornAgain fitting examples.

In this directory one can find examples of complete applications
used for fitting.

--- ex01_SampleParametersIntro ---
    This example shows how to create a sample with fixed parameters and then
    change this parameters on the fly during runtime.
    The example doesn't contain any fitting and serve as a gentle introduction
    to other fitting examples.

--- ex02_FitBasics ---
    FitCylindersAndPrisms.py - shows minimal fitting example
    FitCylindersAndPrisms_detailed.py - is more detailed version + some graphical output
    FitCylindersInSquareLattice.py - demonstrates how to fit many sample parameters with one fit parameter

--- ex03_FitSpheresInHexLattice ---
    Two parameter fit of spheres in a hex lattice.
    FitSpheresInHexLattice.py - demonstrate standard approach
    FitSpheresInHexLattice_builder.py - shows advanced way using sample builder, which might be useful for complex
    samples

--- ex04_FitScaleAndShift ---
    FitScaleAndShift.py - in this example we are trying to fit the data representing cylinders without interference
    on top of substrate. Real data contains some "unknown" background and scale factors.
    In four parameters fit we are looking for cylinder's height, radius and for background and scale factors.

--- ex05_FitWithMasks ---
    FitWithMasks.py - two parameter fit of cylinders without interference.
    Real data contains various masks to simulate and fit only the area outside the masks.

--- ex06_FitStrategies ---
    FitStrategyAdjustMinimizer.py - in this example we are trying to find cylinder's height and radius using chain
    of minimizers. During the first fit round Genetic minimizer will be used. It will roughly look for possible
    minimas. After it is done, the second Minuit2 minimizer will continue to find the precise location of global
    minima.

--- ex07_FitAlongSlices ---
    FitAlongSlices.py - here we demonstrate how to fit along slices.
    The basic idea is to mask all detector except thin lines, one vertical and one horizontal, representing slices.
    This will make simulation and fitting to go along slices only.

--- ex08_SimultaneousFitOfTwoDatasets ---
    SimultaneousFitOfTwoDatasets.py - simultaneous fit of two datasets.
    Suppose that we have same sample measured for two different incident angles. We are going to fit both datasets
    simultaneously to find unknown sample parameters.
    To do this, we define one dataset ( a pair of real_data and simulation model) for the first incidence angle
    and another pair of (real_data, simulation model) for the second incidence angle.
    We add both pairs to the FitSuite and run fitting as usual.

--- ex09_FitSpecular
    This directory containes examples for fitting specular data
    FitSpecularBasics.py - basic demosntration of fitting specular data with BornAgain. GENX simulation results are
                           used as reference data.

--- ex10_FitGALAXIData
    This directory contains an example of fitting data from real detector (GALAXI)
